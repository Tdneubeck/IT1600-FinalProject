# Digital Audio Formats

There are many different types of audio files that serve many different purposes and were created by different people. The formats differ in how they are encoded, compressed, and stored. I will cover some of the most popular audio file formats that have been created.

### Uncompressed Files
##### PCM
PCM stands for Pulse-Code Modulation, and PCM is the format which is the way I have explained Digital Audio. PCM takes sound as a wave and converts it into digital numbers in samples or pulses. This tends to be the most accurate format, however also tends to be one of the largest formats.  PCM is most used in DVDs and CDs.
##### WAV 
Windows Audio File (WAV) is the format established by Microsoft and IBM. WAV files are a container for many different audio formats so sometimes it is not uncompressed. WAV files most often hold PCM audio in their files in a way that makes it easier for Windows systems to use.
##### AIFF
Audio interchange file format is the Apple version of WAV files. they are files created by Apple to help their system manage the files. 
### Lossless Compressed Files
##### MP3
MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3) is one of the most popular audio file types of our generation. MP3 compresses the audio in a way to reduces the storage space significantly while maintaining a quality sound. MP3 was used in mp3 players back in the day and most recently used for music streaming through apps like **Spotify** and **Apple Music**

### Lossy Compressed Files
##### FLAC
FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. FLAC has become a popular lossless form of digital audio. This open-source and royalty-free format reduces the size of the file by up to 60% without losing any data. FLAC is supported on many different platforms so it is a popular alternative to MP3. Many believe FLAC is the best format to use.  

#### ALAC
ALAC is the Apple alternative to FLAC. ALAC stands for Apple Lossless Audio Codec. ALAC has a bit worse compression efficiency than FLAC but Apple users are only able to use ALAC in iTunes and IOS and are unable to use FLAC.
