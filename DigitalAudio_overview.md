# Digital Audio

### Overview
In regards to sound, Computers act very much like our human minds in receiving, processing, and outputting audio. However, a computer uses a screen to visualize what happens in milliseconds in our heads. A computer takes in vibrations through a microphone and converts the sound into numbers that the computer can use. The sound is broken up into thousands of pieces which are called samples

### Sample Rate
The samples in digital audio are arranged in a wave-like form. The sample rate is the number of samples per second that make up the wave. The Sample rate is measured in kHz which means that there are 1000 samples per second. The most common sample rate used in digital audio is 44.1 kHz. This means that there are 44,100 samples per second. This number is found by doubling the maximum frequency that humans can hear. This is called the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.

### Bit Depth
The bit depth is the number of bits used to represent the values for each sample. If the bit depth is 16 bits then there are 65,536 possible values a single sample could be. if it has a lower bit depth, like 8 bits, it would take fewer bits to represent an entire song. However, this would also produce a lower-quality product. This is part of digital audio compression that will be talked about on the next page.
